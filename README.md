# Fire forecasting for South East National Forest in Australia

Basically we are going to forecast the _active fire_ by 8-Day, using two fire products, precipitation and air temperature data.


### Datasets:
- [Temperature data from reanalysis product (at daily scale resolution)] (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/forecasts/reforecast2/download.html)

- [Precipitation data from reanalysis product (at daily resolution)] (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/forecasts/reforecast2/download.html)
- [MODIS EVI product (at 16-Day resolution)] (https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLT/MOD13A2.006/)
- [MODIS/Terra Thermal Anomalies & Fire data product (at 8-Day resolution)] (https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLT/MOD14A2.006/)
- [VIIRS I Band 750 m Active Fire Product NRT (at 8-Day resolution)] (https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/VIIRS/VNP14A1.001/)

### Data Info:
ROI: H29 V12 in MODIS tier
